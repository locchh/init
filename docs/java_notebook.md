To run Java code in a Jupyter Notebook, you can use a kernel that supports Java. There are several ways to achieve this, but one common approach is to use the **IJava** kernel, which provides a Java environment in Jupyter notebooks.

### Steps to Set Up Java in Jupyter Notebook

1. **Install Jupyter Notebook**
   - If you don't have Jupyter Notebook installed yet, you can install it via `pip`:
     ```bash
     pip install notebook
     ```

2. **Install Java**
   - Ensure that Java is installed on your system. You can check by running:
     ```bash
     java -version
     ```
   - If Java is not installed, you can download and install it from the [official Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) or install OpenJDK via your package manager (e.g., `apt-get install openjdk-11-jdk` on Ubuntu).

3. **Install Jupyter-Kernel for Java**
   To install IJava, you will use the `jupyter-kernelspec` tool:
   
   - Download and install the IJava kernel by running the following commands:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/SpencerPark/IJava.git
     cd IJava
     ./gradlew install
     ```

4. **Start Jupyter Notebook**
   - After installing the kernel, you can start Jupyter Notebook:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook
     ```
   - Once Jupyter opens in your web browser, you should see the **Java** kernel as an option when creating a new notebook.

5. **Run Java Code**
   - Now you can write and execute Java code directly in Jupyter cells.

   Example:
   ```java
   System.out.println("Hello, World!");
   ```

### Alternative: Using `BeakerX` for Multiple Languages Including Java

Another alternative is to use **BeakerX**, which is a Jupyter notebook extension that supports multiple languages, including Java. Here's how to install it:

1. Install `BeakerX`:
   ```bash
   conda install -c conda-forge beakerx
   ```

2. Install the Java Kernel:
   ```bash
   beakerx install
   ```

3. Restart your Jupyter Notebook and select the **Java** kernel.

### Conclusion

Once you follow these steps, you'll be able to write and run Java code directly in your Jupyter Notebook. You can also explore other kernels or extensions based on your needs, but **IJava** and **BeakerX** are the most popular choices.
